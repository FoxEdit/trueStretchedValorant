# True Stretched Valorant 🖥️
To work correctly, you need to set an option in the settings of your 
GPU that will stretch the screen when using 
a resolution lower than your monitor supports 
(so that there are no black bars)

## Get Started 🚀  
It is necessary to make some initial settings for the program to work correctly.
1. Set game resolution to your maximum resolution that your monitor supports
2. Set display mode to "windowed"
3. Set aspect ratio method to "fill"
4. Apply settings

## Usage ✨
Just open the tsv.exe file and press any key.
After that, just play the game. When you are done 
playing, go back to the console window and press any key again, 
this will reset your resolution back to the original one.
